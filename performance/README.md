# Performance

To run these benchmarks:

```
npm run build:performance
open ./performance/index.html
```

## Notes

The components used in the render benchmarks are simple enough to be
implemented by multiple UI or style libraries. The implementations are not
equivalent in functionality.

`react-native-web/stylesheet` is a comparative baseline that implements a
simple `View` without much of React Native's functionality.

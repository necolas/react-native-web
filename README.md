# React Native for Web

[![npm version][package-badge]][package-url] [![Build Status][ci-badge]][ci-url] [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html#your-first-pull-request)

"React Native for Web" makes it possible to run [React Native][react-native-url] components and APIs on the web using React DOM.

## Documentation

The [documentation site](https://necolas.github.com/react-native-web/) covers installation, guides, and APIs.

## Example

And here is a simple example to get you started. The example app includes interactive examples and the [source code](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web/blob/master/packages/docs) is also available.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { AppRegistry, StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.box}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>Hello, world!</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  box: { padding: 10 },
  text: { fontWeight: 'bold' }
});

AppRegistry.registerComponent('App', () => App);
AppRegistry.runApplication('App', { rootTag: document.getElementById('react-root') });
```

This example will render the `App` into a container on the page.

You'll notice that there is no reference to `react-dom`; the `App` component is defined using the platform-agnostic APIs and Components introduced by React Native. This allows the app to be rendered to web and native platforms.

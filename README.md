# React Native for Web

[![npm version][package-badge]][package-url] [![Build Status][ci-badge]][ci-url] [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html#your-first-pull-request)

**Compatibility: React Native 0.55**.

"React Native for Web" makes it possible to run [React
Native][react-native-url] components and APIs on the web using React DOM. Check
out the live demo of the [React Native examples][examples-url] running on the
web.

* **High-quality web interfaces**: makes it easy to
create [fast](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web/blob/master/packages/benchmarks/README.md),
adaptive web UIs in JavaScript. It provides native-quality interactions, support
for multiple input modes (touch, mouse, keyboard), optimized vendor-prefixed
styles, built-in support for RTL layout, built-in accessibility, and integrates
with React Dev Tools.

* **Write once, render anywhere**: interoperates with existing React DOM
components and is compatible with the majority of the React Native API. You can
develop new components for native and web without rewriting existing code.
React Native for Web can also render to HTML and critical CSS on the server
using Node.js.

Who is using React Native in production web apps?
[Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com), [Major League
Soccer](https://matchcenter.mlssoccer.com),
[Flipkart](https://www.flipkart.com/), Playstation, Uber, [The
Times](https://github.com/newsuk/times-components).

Browser support: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari 7+, IE 10+.

## Quick start

The easiest way to get started is to edit this
[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/q4qymyp2l6) template (or
[Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/react-native)). You donâ€™t need to install
anything to try it out.

For installation and configuration details please read the [getting
started](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web/blob/master/packages/website/guides/getting-started.md)
guide.

## Documentation

You can find the API documentation [on the website][website-url].

Please refer to the [React Native documentation][react-native-url] for more
design details, and for information about the [Gesture Responder
system](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/gesture-responder-system.html)
and [animations](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animations.html).

## Examples

There are examples [on the website][website-url] ([source
code](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web/blob/master/packages/website)).
And all the [React Native examples][examples-url] ([source
code](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web/blob/master/packages/examples))
are also available. Here is an example to get you started:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { AppRegistry, StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.box}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>Hello, world!</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  box: { padding: 10 },
  text: { fontWeight: 'bold' }
});

AppRegistry.registerComponent('App', () => App);
AppRegistry.runApplication('App', { rootTag: document.getElementById('react-root') });
```

This example will render the `App` into a container on the page.

You'll notice that there is no reference to `react-dom`; the `App` component is
defined using the platform-agnostic APIs and Components introduced by React
Native. This allows the app to be rendered to web and native platforms.

## Integrations

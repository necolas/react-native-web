# React Native for Web

[![npm version][package-badge]][package-url] [![Build Status][ci-badge]][ci-url] [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html#your-first-pull-request) [![Meercode CI Score](https://meercode.io/badge/necolas/react-native-web?type=ci-score&branch=master)](https://meercode.io/necolas/react-native-web)

**Compatibility: React Native >= 0.63**.

"React Native for Web" makes it possible to run [React
Native][react-native-url] components and APIs on the web using React DOM.

* **High-quality web interfaces**: makes it easy to
create [fast](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web/blob/master/packages/benchmarks/README.md),
adaptive web UIs in JavaScript. It provides native-quality interactions, support
for multiple input modes (touch, mouse, keyboard), optimized vendor-prefixed
styles, built-in support for RTL layout, built-in accessibility, and integrates
with React Dev Tools.

* **Write once, render anywhere**: interoperates with existing React DOM
components and is compatible with the majority of the React Native API. You can
develop new components for native and web without rewriting existing code.
React Native for Web can also render to HTML and critical CSS on the server
using Node.js.

Browser support: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari 7+, IE 10+.

Components and APIs deprecated in React Native are not supported by React Native for Web.

## Quick start

The easiest way to get started is to edit this
[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/q4qymyp2l6) template. You don’t need to
install anything to try it out.

## Documentation

The [documentation app](https://necolas.github.com/react-native-web/docs) covers
installation, configuration, APIs, and guides.

The [React Native documentation][react-native-url] contains more information
about the [Gesture Responder
system](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/gesture-responder-system.html),
[animations](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animations.html), and
other design details.

## Examples

And here is a simple example to get you started. The documentation includes
interactive examples and the [source
code](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web/blob/master/packages/docs) is
also available.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { AppRegistry, StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.box}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>Hello, world!</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  box: { padding: 10 },
  text: { fontWeight: 'bold' }
});

AppRegistry.registerComponent('App', () => App);
AppRegistry.runApplication('App', { rootTag: document.getElementById('react-root') });
```

This example will render the `App` into a container on the page.

You'll notice that there is no reference to `react-dom`; the `App` component is
defined using the platform-agnostic APIs and Components introduced by React
Native. This allows the app to be rendered to web and native platforms.

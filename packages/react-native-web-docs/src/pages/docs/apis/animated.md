:::lead
Animated focuses on declarative relationships between inputs and outputs, configurable transforms in between, and start/stop methods to control time-based animation execution.
:::

This API is the same JavaScript implementation as found in React Native. Please refer to the React Native documentation below:

* [Animated](https://reactnative.dev/docs/animated)

:::callout
**Warning!** The React Native animation API is not optimized for the web. You may prefer to use external modules that are designed for multi-platform animations and provide better performance, e.g., [React Spring](https://www.react-spring.io/).

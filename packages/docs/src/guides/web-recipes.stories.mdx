# Web recipes

Examples of how to implement web patterns with React Native.

#### `html` and `body` styles

The `html` and `body` elements require certain styles to support full-screen
React Native apps, and disable "features" like pull-to-refresh in mobile
browsers. Using the `body` as the root scroll view is [not reliably
supported](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web/issues/829).

[Example code](https://codesandbox.io/s/52x1871vjl).

#### Hover styles

Relying on the web's native hover styles can result in several unwanted UX
consequences. Hover styles might be displayed during touch interactions and can
remain visually "stuck". Furthermore, there's no way to delay or persist hover
for accessibility purposes. This recipe shows how to apply hover styles that
integrate with the Responder event system (e.g., the `Touchable*` press styles)
and display styles *only* when the mouse is active. It can also be used as the
basis for programmatic hover delays and rendering of components (e.g., hover
cards).

#### Link styles

Cross-platform link components are straight-forward to create and can be
combined with the hover recipe.

#### Typography

Rather than relying on inhereted global typography styles, React Native allows
you to define components that encapsulate a typographic system. This has the
added benefit of enabling content-specific typography adjustments, e.g.,
different font sizes or weights for different languages.

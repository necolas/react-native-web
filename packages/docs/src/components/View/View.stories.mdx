# View

View is the fundamental UI building block. It is a component that supports
style, layout with flexbox, and accessibility controls. It can be nested inside
another View and has zero-to-many children of any type.

## Props

Please also refer to the in-depth "Accessibility" and "Style" guides.

<Props of={Stories.ofProps} />

### hitSlop

This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view (in pixels).
Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least 30 - 40
points/density-independent pixels.

For example, if a touchable view has a height of 20 the touchable height can be
extended to 40 with hitSlop.

```js
<View hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}} />
```

### onLayout

This is invoked when a component is mounted and when its layout changes. `x` and
`y` are the offsets from the parent node.

```
const onLayout = ({
  nativeEvent: {
    layout: { x, y, width, height }
  }
}) => {}

<View onLayout={onLayout} />
```

### onMoveShouldSetResponder

Does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness? This is called for every
touch move on the View when it is not the responder.

### onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture

If a parent View wants to prevent a child View from becoming responder on a
move, it should have this handler return `true`.

### onResponderGrant

The View is now responding to touch events. This is the time to highlight and
show the user what is happening. For most touch interactions, you'll simply want
to wrap your component in `TouchableHighlight` or `TouchableOpacity`.

### onResponderMove

The user is moving their finger.

### onResponderReject

Another responder is already active and will not release it to the View asking
to be the responder.

### onResponderRelease

Fired at the end of the touch.

### onResponderTerminate

The responder has been taken from the view.

### onResponderTerminationRequest

Some other view wants to become responder and is asking this view to release its
responder. Returning `true` allows its release.

### onStartShouldSetResponder

Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?

### onStartShouldSetResponderCapture

If a parent view wants to prevent a child view from becoming the responder on a
touch start, it should have this handler return true.

### pointerEvents

Controls whether the View can be the target of touch events. Allowed values are
`auto`, `box-only`, `box-none`, and `none`. A value of `box-none` preserves
pointer events on the element's children; `box-only` disables pointer events on
the element's children.

### testID

Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests. The test ID is rendered to a
`data-testid` DOM attribute.

#### flexbox

Flexbox is the default layout for Views. By default, every view has a column
layout that stretches its children, which is very similar to block layout.

<Preview withSource='none'>
  <Story name="styleFlexbox">
    <Stories.styleFlexbox />
  </Story>
</Preview>

#### shadows

<Preview withSource='none'>
  <Story name="styleBoxShadow">
    <Stories.styleBoxShadow />
  </Story>
</Preview>

#### transform

The `transform` value must be an array of objects, for example:

```js
const style = {
  transform: [
    { perspective: 300 },
    { translateX: 100 },
    { translateY: 50 },
    { rotate: '30deg' },
    { scaleX: 2 },
  ]
}
```

#### zIndex

Every instance of `View` has `relative` positioning by default and `zIndex` can
only be used to control the relative Z-axis stacking of siblings within their
parent.

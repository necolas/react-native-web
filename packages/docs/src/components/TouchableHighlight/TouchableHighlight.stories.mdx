# TouchableHighlight

A wrapper for making views respond properly to touches. On press down, the
opacity of the wrapped view is decreased, which allows the underlay color to
show through, darkening or tinting the view.

The underlay comes from wrapping the child in a new View, which can affect
layout, and sometimes cause unwanted visual artifacts if not used correctly, for
example if the backgroundColor of the wrapped view isn't explicitly set to an
opaque color.

TouchableHighlight must have one child (not zero or more than one). If you wish
to have several child components, wrap them in a View.

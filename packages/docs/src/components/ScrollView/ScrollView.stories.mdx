# ScrollView

A scrollable view that provides integration with the touch-locking responder
system. `ScrollView` must have a bounded height: either set the height of the
view directly (discouraged) or make sure all parent views have bounded height
(e.g., transfer `{ flex: 1}` down the view stack).

### contentContainerStyle

These styles will be applied to the scroll view content container which wraps all of the child views.

### horizontal

When `true`, the scroll view's children are arranged horizontally in a row instead of vertically in a column.

<Preview withSource="none">
  <Story name="vertical">
    <Stories.vertical />
  </Story>
</Preview>

<Preview withSource="none">
  <Story name="horizontal">
    <Stories.horizontal />
  </Story>
</Preview>

### keyboardDismissMode

Determines whether the keyboard gets dismissed in response to a scroll drag.

- `none` (the default): drags do not dismiss the keyboard.
- `on-drag`: the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins.
- `interactive` (not supported on web; same as `none`)

### onContentSizeChange

Called when scrollable content view of the `ScrollView` changes. It's
implemented using the `onLayout` handler attached to the content container which
this `ScrollView` renders.

### onScroll

Fires at most once per frame during scrolling. The frequency of the events can
be controlled using the `scrollEventThrottle` prop.

Invoked on scroll with the following event:

```js
{
  nativeEvent: {
    contentOffset: { x, y },
    contentSize: { height, width },
    layoutMeasurement: { height, width }
  }
}
```

<Preview withSource="none">
  <Story name="onScroll">
    <Stories.onScroll />
  </Story>
</Preview>

### pagingEnabled

When `true`, the scroll view snaps to individual items in the list when scrolling.

### scrollEnabled

When `false`, the content does not scroll.

<Preview withSource="none">
  <Story name="scrollEnabled">
    <Stories.scrollEnabled />
  </Story>
</Preview>

### scrollEventThrottle

This controls how often the scroll event will be fired while scrolling (as a
time interval in ms). A lower number yields better accuracy for code that is
tracking the scroll position, but can lead to scroll performance problems. The
default value is `0`, which means the scroll event will be sent only once each
time the view is scrolled.

### stickyHeaderIndices

An array of child indices determining which children get docked to the top of
the screen when scrolling. For example, passing `stickyHeaderIndices=0` will cause
the first child to be fixed to the top of the scroll view. This property is not
supported in conjunction with the `horizontal` prop.

## Instance methods

### getInnerViewNode()

Returns a reference to the underlying content container DOM node within the `ScrollView`.

### getScrollableNode()

Returns a reference to the underlying scrollable DOM node.

### getScrollResponder()

Returns a reference to the underlying scroll responder, which supports
operations like `scrollTo()`. All `ScrollView`-like components should implement
this method so that they can be composed while providing access to the
underlying scroll responder's methods.

### scrollTo()

Scrolls to a given `x`, `y` offset (animation depends on browser support for `scroll-behavior`).

```js
scrollRef.scrollTo({ x, y, animated });
```

### scrollToEnd()

Scrolls to the end of the scroll view.

```js
scrollRef.scrollToEnd({ animated });
```

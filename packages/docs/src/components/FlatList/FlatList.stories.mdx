# FlatList

An interface for rendering basic, flat lists. Please refer to the React Native
[documentation for FlatList](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/flatlist).

Note that `FlatList` is not optimized for the web. You may wish to consider
alternatives such as
[recyclerlistview](https://github.com/Flipkart/recyclerlistview) and
[FastList](https://gist.github.com/vishnevskiy/f4ba74adf5cf1d269b860fab86e8feef).

### Single column

<Preview withSource='none'>
  <Story name="singleColumn">
    <Stories.singleColumn />
  </Story>
</Preview>

### Multiple columns

<Preview withSource='none'>
  <Story name="multiColumn">
    <Stories.multiColumn />
  </Story>
</Preview>

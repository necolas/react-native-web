# TouchableWithoutFeedback

Do not use unless you have a very good reason. All the elements that respond to
press should have a visual feedback when touched. This is one of the primary
reason a "web" app doesn't feel "native".

NOTE: `TouchableWithoutFeedback` supports only one child. If you wish to have
several child components, wrap them in a `View`.

## Props

<Props of={stories.ofProps} />

### delayLongPress

Delay in ms, from `onPressIn` to before `onLongPress` is called. The default is `500`.

### delayPressIn

Delay in ms, from pointer down to before `onPressIn` is called.

### delayPressOut

Delay in ms, from pointer up to before `onPressOut` is called.

### disabled

Disables all pointer interactions with the element.

<Preview withSource='none'>
  <Story name="disabled">{stories.disabled}</Story>
</Preview>

### onLongPress

Called when the pointer is held down for as long as the value of `delayLongPress`.

### onPress

Called when the pointer is released, but not if cancelled (e.g. by a scroll that steals the responder lock).

### pressRetentionOffset

When the scroll view is disabled, this defines how far the pointer may move off
of the element before it becomes deactivated. Once deactivated, try moving the pointer
back over the element and you'll see that the element is once again reactivated!
Move it back and forth several times while the scroll view is disabled. Ensure
you pass in a constant to reduce memory allocations.

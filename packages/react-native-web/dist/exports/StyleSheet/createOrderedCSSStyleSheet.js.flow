 * Each rule is associated with a numerically defined group.
 * Groups are ordered within the style sheet according to their number, with the
 * lowest first.
 *
 * Groups are implemented using marker rules. The selector of the first rule of
 * each group is used only to encode the group number for hydration. An
 * alternative implementation could rely on CSSMediaRule, allowing groups to be
 * treated as a sub-sheet, but the Edge implementation of CSSMediaRule is
 * broken.

### New Features

Please open an issue with a proposal for a new feature or refactoring before
starting on the work. We don't want you to waste your efforts on a pull request
that we won't want to accept.

## Pull requests

**Before submitting a pull request**, please make sure the following is done:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests!
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the tests pass (`yarn test`).

You can now submit a pull request, referencing any issues it addresses.

Please try to keep your pull request focused in scope and avoid including
unrelated commits.

After you have submitted your pull request, we'll try to get back to you as
soon as possible. We may suggest some changes or improvements.

Thank you for contributing!

```
yarn release <version>

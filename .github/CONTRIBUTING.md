## New Features

Please open an issue with a proposal for a new feature or refactoring before starting on the work. We don't want you to waste your efforts on a pull request that we won't want to accept.

## Pull requests

**Before submitting a pull request**, please make sure the following is done:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests!
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the tests pass (`npm run test`).

You should see a pre-commit hook run before each commit.

You can now submit a pull request, referencing any issues it addresses.

Please try to keep your pull request focused in scope and avoid including unrelated commits.

After you have submitted your pull request, it's recommended that **you** perform the first code review. We'll try to get back to you as soon as possible and may suggest changes.

Thank you for contributing!
